I've finished most of the things I was planning for this week-and-a-half, but I
still haven't finished the pizza, so I'm going to do that Saturday or Sunday.

I've had pizza from the coal, neo-neapolitan, squares and specialty categories.

In order to have had one from each of Jared's categories, I want to go to Joe's
(New York), at 7 Carmine Street, and Numero 28 (Roman), at 28 Carmine Street.

Once I finish those, I'll either go to some non-pizza thing in the city or to
more pizza from Jared's list.

You are welcome to join.
