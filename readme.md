New York Pizza
======

`pizza.csv` lists pizzarias grouped by type. If I have eaten a pizzaria's
pizza, I have noted when; NA indicates that I've eaten there many times and
have forgotten when.

I've had pizza from the coal, neo-neapolitan, squares and specialty categories;
in order to have had one from each of Jared's categories, I want to go to Joe's
(New York), at 7 Carmine Street, and Numero 28 (Roman), at 28 Carmine Street.
